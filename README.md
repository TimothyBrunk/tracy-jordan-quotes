## Scope 

I've been a back-end Java developer since 2016 with some front-end experience in writing Angular 5 web apps. I wanted to get my feet wet writing a mobile app. I specifically wanted to use my current knowledge of Angular 5 and its powerful command line interface (CLI) and find a framework that would dovetail nicely with Angular. 

## NativeScript

At the time of writing this simple application I had tried a few different framework demos and liked the CLI option with NativeScript. NativeScript also contained a simple command for quickly building a mobile application with Angular 5 woven into it.
